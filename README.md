This is the initial setup for the Timeline App. It includes the following:
- A header with a logo and a theme toggle button.
- A navigation section with placeholder filter buttons.
- A main content area with:
  - A `<section id="timeline">` containing example event entries.
  - An empty `<div>` for future modal pop-ups.
- Semantic HTML tags like `<main>`, `<article>`, `<figure>` for structured content.
